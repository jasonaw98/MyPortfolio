# Hello there, I'm Jason Aw

I'm a full-time Software QA Engineer and a freelance Developer. I love automation as they make life easier. 
I also love to build fun projects during my spare time. I'm currently seeking a challenging opportunity where I will be able
to further my programming skills, educational
background, develop soft skills and ability to work well
with people, which allow me to grow personally and
professionally. Huge appetite for career growth and
development.
